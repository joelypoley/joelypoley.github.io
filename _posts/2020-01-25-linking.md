title:  "How linking works"
---


## I. Introduction

C++ programs must be compiled and linked before they can be executed.
Compilation takes each human-readable `.cc` file as input and produces a machine readable `.o` file  as output.
Since a `.cc` file can use a function defined in another file, linking is necessary to match up the call sites of a function with its definition and produce the final executable.

It is not always obvious that linking is a separate step from compilation because command line tools like `g++` do _both_ the compilation and linking in one go.

## II. Separate compilation and linking example

We'll use this simple program as a running example.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/joelypoley/24ebabf2958db33c2bedcc8b479d0be7.js"></script>

To produce an executable file from the source code above, type:

```shell
$ g++ square.cc main.cc  # Compile and link square.cc and main.cc.
```

If you want to separately compile and then link you can type:

```shell
$ g++ -c square.cc  # Compile square.cc to machine code.
$ g++ -c main.cc    # Compile main.cc to machine code.
$ g++ square.o main.o  # Link square.o and main.o.
```

The `-c` flag tells `g++` to compile the file without linking.
When you pass `.o` files to `g++` it will link them together.

`g++ -c square.cc` takes the source code in `square.cc`, converts in to machine code that can be executed by your computer and finally puts that exectuable code in the `square.o` file along with some bookkeeping information.

The `square` function is _declared_ in `main.cc` but it is not _defined_ in `main.cc`.

A declaration looks like `int square(int x);`, it tells the compiler the types of the return values and the arguments of the function.
This allows the compiler to type check the function call `square(3)` without having to know how `square` is implemented<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
Typically declarations will be in a header file.

A definition contains the actual body of the function.
In our example, the `square` function is defined in `square.cc`.

After `main.cc` is compiled, the `main.o` file contains the machine code for the `main` function and some metadata which records that the `square` function is declared, but not defined, in `main.o`.

In the final step, `g++ square.o main.o` links the object files into an executable program by matching up the function declaration in `main.o` with the function defined in `square.o`.


## III. Linking with system libraries

Most libraries will have many source files, and therefore many `.o` files.
When distributing a library on the internet, it is typical for the object files in the library to be bundled together into an _archive file_ ending in the `.a` extension.
A `.a` file bundles a bunch of `.o` files together for convenient linking.

When you install a C library on Linux, the headers for the library are typically placed in `/usr/local/include` and the `.a` file in `/usr/local/lib`.

The compiler will automatically look in `/usr/local/include` for headers (again this only applies to Linux, type `g++ -E -Wp,-v -` to see the full include path).

To tell the compiler to link with a `.a` in `/usr/local/lib`, pass the flag `-l<name of library>` to the compiler (type `g++ -print-search-dirs` to see the full link path).

For example, I recently installed [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) on my computer.
It added `libfftw3.a` to my `/usr/local/lib` directory.
To link with this library I type:

```
g++ main.cc -lfftw3
```

Note the `lib` prefix is omitted, there is no space between `-l` and `fftw3` and the `-lfftw3` flag is after the source file which uses it.

## IV. Inspecting object files

When researching this blog post, I found it really helpful to actually inspect the object files produced by the compiler.
`objdump` can do this.

First, add some global variables to `square.cc` to make it more interesting.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/joelypoley/cf72b7a203d481731f295071ab3697a7.js"></script>

To use `objdump`, type:

```shell
$ g++ -c square.cc
$ objdump --disassemble --full-contents --all-headers --section=.text --section=.rodata --section=.data square.o
```

The `--disassemble` flag shows the assembly for our functions, `--full-contents` shows the contents of each section of the object file in both hex and ascii, `all-headers` shows the symbol table and sections, `--section=.text --section=.rodata --section=.data` filters the results to only include the functions we defined, global read-only data and global data.

The output is:

```

The first line

```
square.o:     file format elf64-x86-64
```

tells us that the file is in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).
This is the default object code format on Linux.
On macOS it is Mach-O and on Windows there is COM, PE and PE32+.

The object file is organized into sections.
Metadata about the sections are displayed in a table.

```

The symbol table is a table which contains metadata about every global variable and function.
For example, the entry `_Z6squarei` is the entry for the `square` function.
The compiler transforms the names of functions in a process called [name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling) to encode type information (and potentially other data such as which namespace the function was declared in) into the function name.
This ensures that even if we declare two different functions with same name such as `int square(int x)` and `double square(double x)`, every entry in the symbol table will have a unique name.
You can add the flag `--demangle` to `objdump` to make the names more human-readable.

```
SYMBOL TABLE:
0000000000000000 l    d  .text	0000000000000000 .text
0000000000000000 l    d  .data	0000000000000000 .data

0000000000000000 g     F .text	0000000000000010 _Z6squarei
```

The contents of each of the sections is shown in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) and ASCII.
The `.text` section contains the machine code for the `square` function, the `.data` section contains our global variable `x` (which has value 3) and  the `.rodata` section (read-only data) has our `greeting` variable (which has value "Hello, world!").

## V.

Many statically typed languages such as C, Rust and Swift follow the same model as C++: separate compilation of source files followed by linking.
This means you can call e.g. C functions from Swift by compiling the human-readable source files into object files and linking them together.
It's useful to know about linking if you want to interop between C and more modern languages.

Even if you just stick to C++, some of the [darker corners of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule#Example_showing_unexpected_side_effects) and the more [inscrutable error messages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12573816/what-is-an-undefined-reference-unresolved-external-symbol-error-and-how-do-i-fix) from the compiler are due to C++'s linking model.
Having a good mental model of linking and compilation can save hours of debugging.
